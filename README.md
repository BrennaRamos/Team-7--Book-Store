# Team-7--Book-Store
Repository for Team 7's Online Book Store Development

----------
This is the branch that will contain updates for our project up until Sprint 1. Any changes made here, once confirmed to be functional, can be merged to the master branch to update it. (master branch should ideally contain the final product once the semester is over if we follow this process)
Once Sprint 2 comes around, we should make a new branch of updated master and call it sprint-2. This way, we keep track of our progress over time. Note: master should be merged with sprint-2 once updates want to be reflected.
Following this process for sprints 3 4 and 5 would prove useful.

If my understanding of how Github repositories works is incorrect or inaccurate, please feel free to update this README file with the right steps we should take :)
